								MOVE ALL ZEROES TO END

You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.



									SOLUTION


class Solution:
	def pushZerosToEnd(self,arr):
	    pos = 0
	    n = len(arr)
    	for i in range(n):
    	    if arr[i] != 0:
    	        arr[pos] = arr[i]
    	        pos += 1
        
        while pos < n:
            arr[pos] = 0
            pos += 1
    	    
    	return arr
